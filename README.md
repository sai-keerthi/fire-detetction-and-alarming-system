History has proven that early detection of a fire and the signaling of an appropriate alarm remain significant factors in preventing large losses due to fire. Properly installed and maintained fire detection and alarm systems can help to increase the survivability of occupants and emergency responders while decreasing property losses.
 The technologies underlying fire and smoke detection systems play a crucial role in ensuring and delivering optimal performance in modern surveillance environments. In fact, fire can cause significant damage to lives and properties.
 Considering that the majority of cities have already installed camera-monitoring systems, this encouraged us to take advantage of the availability of these systems to develop cost-effective vision detection methods. 
A CNN model named InceptionNet V3 is trained with a large dataset of images with and without fire.  With the help of OpenCV, the performance of the model is tested in real-time.
Once fire is detected it will generate a alarm, then an email is sent to the owner regarding the incident.
